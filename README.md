## Custom dropdown menu Box using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
This project contains lot of JavaScript coding which makes
custom dropdown box. It is the enhanced version fo w3schools
custom dropdown menu. The main feature which I included in this
box is to make some of the options header/titles through 'option-header' 
class which are not selectable & act as a heading within options.
The other main feature is to  enable/disable specific boxes through
input data.
